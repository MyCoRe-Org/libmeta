# LibMeta - Java Object Models and APIs for Common Library Metadata Standards
**These Java libraries provide a set of Java models and APIs,
which provide a unified approach to the creation and processing of library metadata objects.**

- A corresponding Java object model was derived for each standard.
- JAXB annotations (Java API for XML-Binding) are used with XML-based standards to specify
  the mapping between the Java object model and itâ€˜s XML representation.
- The JSON Binding API is used for the serialization and deserialization of metadata objects
  in JSON-based standards.
- Validator classes are used to check XML data against the corresponding XML Schemas.
